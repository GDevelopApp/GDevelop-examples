# Top-down game (pixel-art)

A top-down 2D game where the player uses the Top-Down Movement behavior to move in all directions. The camera follows the player smoothly as they move around the game scene. The player is prevented from overlapping or passing through obstacle objects such as walls or plants by using collision separation. The game supports both keyboard/mouse controls and mobile touch controls.
