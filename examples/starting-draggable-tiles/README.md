# Board game with draggable tiles

A 2D board game-style game with pieces represented as 2D sprites placed on a grid. Players can pick up and drag pieces to different tiles using a mouse or mobile touch controls. The system prevents multiple pieces from occupying the same grid space and supports multiple distinct game piece types that can be picked up and moved in the scene.
