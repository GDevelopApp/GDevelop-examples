This example shows how to make AI for a platformer

The example uses the platformer behavior to make AI. When the AI is in collision with certain triggers/objects, it either changes a variable that controls the object, or does the action directly. 

Along with the AI, a simple health and damage system using the Flash Extension is present. When the player collides with the AI, the player loses some health and starts flashing. If the player is flashing when in collision with the ai, it doesnâ€™t count. More explanation is present in the event sheet.
