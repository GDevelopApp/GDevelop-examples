# Top-down Farming

A 2D angled top-down farming game where the player uses the Top-Down Movement behavior to move in all directions. The scene includes a ground tilemap with dirt plots where seeds can be planted, solid seed bags and buildings that the player can't pass through, vegetables/crops, and seed bags used to obtain seeds. The player can pick up objects and store them in an inventory, then place objects back onto the ground using a ground selection tool to check if that location is one where the object can be placed. Performing an action on the harvestable seed bag objects will add seeds to the inventory, and seeds can be placed on unoccupied dirt plots to start growing crops. Fully grown crops can be picked up and added to the inventory. The inventory uses UI icons to display the contents of the inventory, as well as allow the player to select which item to use and choose which slot a picked-up object will occupy. The game supports both keyboard/mouse controls and mobile touch controls.
