# 3D Platformer

A 3D physics-based platformer where the player controls a character that can move forward, backward, left, and right, as well as jump and fall. The player can push a 3D physics box, jump on and collide with static boxes, and collect coin objects. A third-person camera follows behind the player, but can also be manually controlled by the player. The game supports both keyboard and mouse controls as well as mobile touch controls.
