# 3D Flight Simulator

A 3D flight game with a plane represented by a 3D model and a ground object the plane cannot pass below. The player controls the plane’s tilt (left/right), pitch (forward/backward), and speed using keyboard or mobile touch controls. A third-person camera follows the plane, following its angle and pitch automatically, to properly follow the player movement.
