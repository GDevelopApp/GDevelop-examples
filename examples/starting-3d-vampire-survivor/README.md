# Vampire Survivors-like game

A 3D vampire survivors-style game with an angled top down camera that follows the player, where the player can move freely along the X and Y axis. Enemies spawn off-screen around the player and continuously move toward them. When enemies get within range, the player automatically fires bullets at them. Enemies take three hits to be destroyed, and the player dies if they collide with an enemy. The game supports keyboard and mobile touch controls.
