# 3D FPS with Gun

A 3D physics-based first-person game where the player can look around and turn using the camera, as well as jump and fall within the environment. The scene includes a ground surface, solid platforms the player can land on, as well as a physics box and targets that reacts realistically when pushed or shot.

The player holds a 3D gun model that can be fired. Firing uses raycasting to detect where the bullet hits, creating a 3D particle effect at the point of impact. Each shot plays a sound effect and causes the screen to shake. The game supports both keyboard/mouse controls and mobile touch controls.
