Test the Object Slicer extension, which can slice an object into smaller pieces that match the color of original object.  

Useful for creating death animations such as explosions, crumbling, dissolve, or teleportation effects.
Pieces should be a solid white color or the color of the piece not match the original color.

Tips:
- Pieces are linked to the original object which can be used in other events (i.e. explode away from the original object)
