# Top-down RTS (unit selection)

A 2D angled top-down RTS-style game where the player can click to select individual units or click and drag to select multiple units. Selected units can be given a waypoint to move to, using pathfinding to navigate around impassable obstacles, like buildings. Water areas are passable but less preferred, so units will avoid them if a better path exists. Unit selection and waypoint placement can be done with either mouse or touch screen controls.
