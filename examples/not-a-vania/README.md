This project is meant as a game example or template for a more advanced platformer. This is in the style of older castlevania entries, such as Castlevania 1 or 3.

There are numerous advanced GDevelop concepts in this project, such as finite state machines (FSMs), tweens, bitmap fonts and bitmap text objects, tilemaps, external event sheets, declaring variables via events, and object variables. 

Before working with this project, it is STRONGLY recommended that you review the following:

At least the first four tutorials on the GDevelop Wiki: http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/tutorials This example uses concepts from EACH of those tutorials and it is important to understand those concepts before trying to adapt these ideas.
