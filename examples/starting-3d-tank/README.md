# 3D tank

A 3D physics-based game where the player controls a tank that can move around the scene, with an independently aimed turret. Firing launches a bullet projectile that follow the turret’s angle and inclination. Stationary enemy targets can be shot and react realistically to explosions, which are visualized with 3D particle effects and screen shake. A third-person camera follows the tank’s movement and orientation. The game supports both keyboard and mobile controls.
