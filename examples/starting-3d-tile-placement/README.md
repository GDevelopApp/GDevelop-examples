# Tile-based builder/strategy

A 3D game with an angled top-down view where tiles are represented by 3D models such as units, castle towers, and trees. Players can select the type of tile to place using UI buttons, and a placement indicator shows where the tile will be positioned. The game prevents overlapping placements and includes a ground grid to indicate valid placement locations. Tile selection and placement can be done with mouse or mobile touch controls, making it suitable for tower defense or city builder-style gameplay.
