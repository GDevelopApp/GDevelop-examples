# Labyrinth

A simple proof-of-concept for a possibly larger, more in-depth game.

You start in the centre of a maze and can only see the area immediately around you. Find your way out using only breadcrumbs to avoid getting lost.

## Controls

Arrow keys to move  
Space to drop/pick-up breadcrumbs

## Ideas

Possible additions to improve/extend the game include:

- Sound effects/ambient music
- Monsters that chase you when in line-of-sight (a Minotaur would be a nice touch)
- Traps (to prevent you going down certain paths until you disable them)
- Collectables:
  - Extra breadcrumbs
  - Health/lives (to counter monster attacks)
  - Something that temporarily zooms the camera out, allowing you to see more of the maze
