Weld joint:  Glue two objects together.

Rope joint: Two objects can get closer to each other but they cannot exceed their starting distance.

Distance joint:  Two objects are forced to stay at set distance from each other.  Adjust the frequency property to change the stiffness of the spring.

Revolute joint:  Two objects are connected but can rotate on the joint.  Angles can be restricted and joints can have motors that spin the objects.
