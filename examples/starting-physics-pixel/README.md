# 2D Physics Game (pixel-art)

A 2D side-view physics game where the player can click or touch and drag a ball to smash it into other 2D physics blocks in the scene. The blocks have varying densities and react differently when struck by the ball, similar to angry birds. A ground object keeps the ball contained within the game screen. The game supports both mouse and mobile touch controls.

Assets and game are optimized for pixel art.
