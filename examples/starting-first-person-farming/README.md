# 3D First Person Farming

A 3D physics-based first-person farming game where the player can look around and turn using the camera, as well as jump and fall within the environment. The scene includes a ground surface, solid seed bags that the player can't pass through, dirt plots for planting vegetables/crops, and seed bags used to obtain seeds. The player can pick up objects and store them in an inventory, then place objects back onto the ground using raycasting to determine the placement location. Harvestable seed bag objects can be clicked to add seeds to the inventory, and seeds can be placed on unoccupied dirt plots to start growing crops. Fully grown crops can be picked up and added to the inventory. The inventory uses UI icons to display the contents of the inventory, as well as allow the player to select which item to use and choose which slot a picked-up object will occupy. The game supports both keyboard/mouse controls and mobile touch controls.
