A 2D, top-down, game where the player can move around and shoot at enemies which are randomly created around the player and moving toward them.
The player movement and shooting direction are independant.
Support for mobile controls (using two virtual joysticks, hence the name "Twin Stick Shooter") and mouse/keyboard.
