In this game the player drops their pachinko ball in an effort to hit as many pegs as possible to accumulate the maximum number of points. This game exhibits a scoring system, a score multiplier, the physics options, the leaderboard system, and more.

The Plinko example showcases the physics behavior and how it along with other tools, like the object shake extension, can create a fun and juicy game.

The example features:
- Physics engine 2.0
- Object shake
- Particles
