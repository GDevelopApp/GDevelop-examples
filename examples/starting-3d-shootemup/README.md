# Shoot 'em up

A 3D top-down shoot ’em up game where the player faces towards the right side of the screen and can move freely within fixed screen boundaries. The player automatically fires bullets toward the right side of the screen. Enemies scroll in from the right side of the screen and continuously move left, and fire bullets forward. Enemies take three hits to be destroyed, and the player dies if hit by an enemy bullet or collides with an enemy. Player movement can be controlled with a keyboard or mobile touch controls.
