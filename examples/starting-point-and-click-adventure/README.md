# 2D Point-and-click adventure

A 2D, angled side-view, point-and-click game where the player click/taps on a location in the game scene, and the player character uses pathfinding to navigate there. When an NPC is clicked/tapped on, the player character will walk to their location and a dialog box opens. The dialog box has text and two clickable options for the player to choose from.

The game supports both mouse and mobile touch controls.
