# 3D FPS Horror game with Gun

A 3D, physics-based first-person shooter set in a fog-covered map. The player can move freely and engage threats using a handheld weapon.

Hostile monsters spawn randomly across the map and patrol toward the player, accelerating as they get closer. If a monster reaches the player, the game restarts.

The gun is fully modeled in 3D, with bullet impact visual effect, screen shake, and recoil to enhance shooting feedback.

Supports both mobile and keyboard controls.
