## Submit your example

If you've created an example with GDevelop, you can submit it to be shared with the rest of the community.

1. **Create your game** with GDevelop.
2. Make sure to follow the [requirements and best practices on this page](http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/community/guide-for-submitting-an-example).
  > Note that for now, we're trying to keep a fairly high quality bar for examples, so you might be asked to adapt your game according to reviewer feedbacks. Don't feel bad about this! This is normal process and here to help making examples as good as possible for new users. If we take too much time to review your example, you can send a ping on the issue. ‚è∞
3. Create a `preview.png` (case sensitive) 16:9 image that will let users see what the game looks like. You can also add a `thumbnail.png` (case sensitive) with a 16:9 ratio (the game logo/banner) shown in the examples list of the game engine or a `square-icon.png` (the game icon).  All of these images should be located at the root folder of the game.
4. Create a new `README.md` file and write a short description of the game.
5. **Export** your game and all its resources to a zip file (you can save it in a new folder and zip this folder).
6. Submit it! You can either [submit it here](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-examples/issues/new/choose), attaching the _zip file_.

If you know how to create *Pull Requests*, you can also clone this repository and add your example in the examples folder, and then open a PR. Examples are deployed automatically when pushed to the `main` branch: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-examples/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-examples/tree/main)
